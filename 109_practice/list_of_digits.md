Lines 1-3 are a method definition that accepts one parameter, `num`, an Integer object. In line two, two methods are called on `num`. First, `#digits` splits the integer into an array of its composite digits, although these digits appear in reverse order. `#reverse` is called to switch them back to their original order. Since line 2 is the final statement of the method, this array is the return value of the method.
