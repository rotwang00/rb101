In line 1 is a method definition, `repeat`, which take two parameters, `str` and `num`, representing a String object and an Integer object. Lines 2-4 are a do loop which will run `num` number of iterations. On line 3 the `puts` methods output the `str` parameter and returns `nil`. The loop ends, then the method ends (returning the value of `num`).

In line 7 the `repeat` method is invoked with the values `'Hello'` and '3'. The method outputs

`Hello`  
`Hello`  
`Hello`

and returns `3`.
